##### Performance #####
#######################

# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to
# actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or
# use a monitor with a high refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when
# there is pending input to be processed, repaint_delay is ignored.
repaint_delay 10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal
# is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but
# also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that
# redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial
# screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents
# tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling.
# However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor.
# With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some
# slight input latency. If so, set this to no.
sync_to_monitor yes

# Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the clipboard.

# You can additionally specify no-append to disable kittyâ€™s protocol extension
# for clipboard concatenation. The default is to allow writing to the

# enabling the read functionality is a security risk as it means that any

# The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this can break
# many terminal programs, only change it if you know what you are doing,
# not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow to change it. The TERM
# variable is used by various programs to get information about the
# capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If you change it, depending on
# what programs you run, and how different the terminal you are changing it
# to is, various things from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced
# features may not work.
